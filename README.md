# Plan

- hotel controller
    get all the links and convert the data and save
    this should be on button click
    mapping should also be customized for each
- helper module
    to clean the data and parse into standard format
- home page and controller

## Database
use sqlite - why this and not relational?
if we are collecting data, displaying it in a systematic way, relational is teh best way to do so, can make full use of indexing strategies to serve large amounts of data.

format, structure and integrity of data is impt.
